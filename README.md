## Hi there 👋

I specialize in **Node.js, Ruby on Rails, Python**, and I’m currently expanding my knowledge into **Clojure and Datomic**.

I enjoy solving complex problems, designing clean architectures, and improving systems through automation and good engineering practices.  
Always curious, always learning.
